NOTE: the karabiner.json is for Mac keyboard shortcut overriding. The configuration in this file tries to mimic a keyboard shortcut setup I had on ubuntu that is preferable over the default keyboard shortcuts on mac. What made the remapping the keyboard shortcuts difficult is that only some ctrl+<key> hotkeys needed to be swapped with cmd+<key>. Karabiner was the only tool I found that provided the customization I needed and it was free.

After installing karabiner-elements and other tools, this file should live in: ~/.config/karabiner/karabiner.json
